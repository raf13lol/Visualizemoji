> *"Why is this not using TypeScript while replicating features of it?"*

I find it easier to work with JS and plus just more convenient imo to avoid compiling.

> *"What's the speed of this?"*

Not very good, I think. If you look in the `test` folder and view `2.mp4`, you can see a test video.
That video takes my pc (very high-end i think) ~1.5 hours to render in the VSC console.
